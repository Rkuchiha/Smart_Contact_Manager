here we are using Model to send data from controller to frontend page 
for e.g. by clicking on email we are sending 
and to map the function or method with front end you have 
to properly match href in frontend component with @RequestMapping
for e.g
href="@{'/user/'+${c.cId}+'/contact'}" in frontend component
here 
@ is use for page direction or mapping
$ is use for object provided by backend in model
| pie is use to send atribute through onclick function 

@RequestMapping("/{cId}/contact")
public String showContactDetail(@PathVariable("cId") Integer cId){} in backend function
